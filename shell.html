      <h1>Shell</h1>
      <h3>Every journey needs a soundtrack</h3>
      <p>South Africans love music. But not just any music. Their music. So, when Shell partnered with Spotify and Universal to curate playlists for their journeys, they had a challenge. In a country with a political past that produced hundreds of music genres and virtually no crossover appeal between themâ€”how do you create a playlist that speaks to everyone? By introducing their artists to each other. And turning fans of one genre into fans of the other.</p>
